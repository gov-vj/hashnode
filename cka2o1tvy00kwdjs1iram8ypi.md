## Chat App - Introduction

This is an introductory chat application. I created this application for a take home job assignment. My goal was to implement the task as quick as possible and having a great UI and security concern was not the top priority.

This is a group based chat forum where anyone can log in and start chatting with everyone else. We are using 
1. Node.js and Express for backend
2. MongoDB and Mongoose framework
3. ws library for WebSocket
